# Minecraft Bedrock Edition
This directory contains a serires of helper scripts used to start, stop, and
check the status of a Minecraft Bedrock server. These scripts are pulled during
the initial startup of a new server instance via the `*_startup_scripts.sh`
scripts in the `startup_scripts` directory.
