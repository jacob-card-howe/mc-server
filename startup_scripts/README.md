# Startup Scripts
This directory contains startup scripts I have used as userdata scripts within
Google Cloud, and AWS. The `*_startup_scripts.sh` files are known, functional
scripts that are currently in use. The other `<minecraft type>.sh` files are old
scripts that may or may not be functional.

> ðŸ‘‹ If you've looked at my `minecraft-cloud` repo, these scripts might look
> familiar! They're the same scripts found in `terraform/vm-scripts/`.
